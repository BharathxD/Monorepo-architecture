# Monorepo architecture

This repository showcases the implementation of ESLint, TailwindCSS, NextJS, and a Utility Package, all integrated with architectural best practices. By leveraging ESLint, code quality and consistency are ensured throughout the project. TailwindCSS provides a highly customizable and utility-first CSS framework, enabling rapid and efficient styling. NextJS, a powerful React framework, offers server-side rendering, routing, and other advanced features for building modern web applications. Additionally, the Utility Package enhances development productivity by providing reusable components and utilities. Combined with architectural best practices, this repository serves as a comprehensive and robust foundation for developing complex frontend applications within a monorepo architecture.
